# Automated Feature Engineering

## Product overview

The solution will provide machine learning related feature engineering as output for the user provided data. The feature engineering operations to execute on the data can be specified by user in a separate config file. This will simplify the task of feature engineering for a data scientist where in the user will only have to specify select few parameter to generate the output feature engineered data instead of writing the complete code for the feature engineering pipeline.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution will transform the user input data by running machine learning related feature engineering operations as specified by the user.  It can process tabular data which can have categorical and numerical values. The solution provides the most common feature engineering techniques including but not limited to check for inter-feature interaction, apply polynomial and trigonometric functions and can also remove rare levels.

* This solution saves a significant amount of time spent over developing and running different feature engineering operations on the data. This improves data scientists/engineers productivity and allows them to focus on more value added parts in the data science experiments.

* PACE - ML is Mphasis Framework and Methodology for end-to-end machine learning development and deployment. PACE-ML enables organizations to improve the quality & reliability of the machine learning solutions in production and helps automate, scale, and monitor them.
